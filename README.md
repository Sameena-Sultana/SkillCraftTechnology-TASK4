# TASK-4:🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis with Visual Insights
A data visualization and pattern discovery project based on real-world traffic accident conditions. This notebook uncovers insights about accident causes and severity using clean visual analytics.
---
## 📝 Task Overview
The goal is to analyze a dataset of traffic accidents to identify significant patterns related to:
- Road type
- Environmental conditions
- Driver behavior
- Accident severity
We use diverse visualizations (bar plots, pie charts, heatmaps, clustering, etc.) to present accident patterns that can inform public safety decisions and urban planning.
---
## 🎯 Objective
- Discover patterns behind traffic accidents using visual analytics.
- Determine how road, weather, traffic, and human factors contribute to accident severity.
- Visualize relationships and trends using expressive and interactive charts.
- Build a visual story to support data-driven decisions for traffic safety.

## ✅  What I Analysed through this task 
- 🌧️ Weather and lighting conditions were key contributors to accidents.
- 🛣️ Highways showed more severe accidents compared to urban roads.
- 🚦 High traffic density combined with higher speed limits led to more serious outcomes.
- 🚗 Driver alcohol involvement significantly increased accident occurrence.
- 📈 A clear trend was found: higher speed limits correlate with more severe accidents.
- 🎨 Successfully used heatmaps, line plots, bar charts and pie charts to explain accident patterns.
- 🤖 Cluster analysis revealed 3–4 major patterns of accident conditions (e.g., young drunk drivers on highways at night).
## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter notebook
- Libraries Used:
- pandas & numpy: Data manipulation
- matplotlib & seaborn: Bar plots, pie charts, line graphs, heatmaps
- plotly: Interactive scatter plots and cluster visualization
- folium: Map-based accident heatmaps (optional if lat-long is present)
